            Insert JavaScript in the HTML header.
            Insert JavaScript into the HTML body (usually at the bottom).
            Include JavaScript files from the same website as the HTML page
            Include JavaScript files from other websites.
        
          
        The choice between HTML page header and body is a timing issue. If you insert code in the HTML header, then it is available for use as the HTML body is displayed. However, compiling JavaScript code takes time so sometimes to improve the Web responsiveness JavaScript code is placed at the bottom of the HTML body. If it is placed at the bottom of the body, then the browser can display the page while the JavaScript code is loaded and compiled. Ideally, code used while displaying the page is in the header while code used afterwards can be placed at the bottom of the page body.
         
        Placing code in separate files is good programming practice when the JavaScript becomes substantial. It also allows re-use of the code where many pages can load the same JavaScript file. It is also common for provided JavaScript files (e.g. various frameworks) to be hosted at the maintainers' websites or public mirror sites so that code can be updated (bug fixed) without the user needing to modify their web pages.
         
        In both cases, there are performance benefits as separate files can be cached by the browser so they do not have to be reloaded from the remote website for each webpage that uses them.
        Now that we know how to add JavaScript to our page lets take a look at how we can start writing our JavaScript code.
